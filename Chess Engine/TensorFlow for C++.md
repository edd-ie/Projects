# Getting Started with TensorFlow for C++

## Introduction
TensorFlow provides a C API that can be used to build bindings for other languages, including C++. You can use the C API to load, inspect, and run saved models and frozen graphs in C++. This guide will help you get started with TensorFlow for C++.

## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Install TensorFlow for C++
   - **Download TensorFlow C Library**: Visit the TensorFlow website and download the appropriate TensorFlow C library for your platform. For example, for Linux CPU only, you can download the `libtensorflow-cpu-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` file.
   - **Extract the Archive**: Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice. For example, you can extract it to `/usr/local/lib` on Linux or macOS.
   - **Configure the Linker**: If you extracted the TensorFlow C library to a system directory, configure the linker with `ldconfig`. If you extracted it to a non-system directory, configure

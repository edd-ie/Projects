## 📊 Tips for Use in Obsidian
- Use the **graph view** to connect notes (e.g., blog drafts, project logs).  
- Embed code snippets directly in notes with \`\`\`cpp blocks.  
- Tag notes by theme: `#C++`, `#fintech`, `#low-latency`, `#projects`.  
- Create daily notes for coding logs / profiling benchmarks.

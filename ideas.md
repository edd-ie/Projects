1. Writing an emulation of an 8bit processor/a whole game console like NES - an awesome low level project that helped me to better understand underlying computer architecture. I chose to make a NES emulator (it has absolutely nothing to do with game dev, so don't worry) and emulated everything from reading and writing memory to parsing and executing the original MOS6502 compiled binaries.
2. HTTP server or any kind of server - this will get you familiar with socket programming and libraries like winsock2, boost/asio ect. I'd suggest making a simple online game but since you're not into gamedev maybe you can find another cool way to incorporate sockets into your projects :D
3. Implementing any kind of solutions to any of the thread synchronisation problems, like the problem of readers and writers.
4. Embedded (THIS and a lot of this!) - I do embedded in a formula student team and it's awesome to see your code take effect on something physical, like a car! You can start out with a raspberryPI board and make all kinds of cool stuff, from making a custom mini computer with a display to writing your own OS. If you'd like to get a bit closer to hardware, boards like STM32 or arduino are also great options for getting started.
